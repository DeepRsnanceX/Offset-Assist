# OffsetAssist
***Offset Assist*** is a very simple tool mod designed for Icon Creators which allows you to Edit and Preview on real time Sprite Offsets for your icons!

This mod is meant to be used alongside the More Icons mod, more specifically, its Icon Editor feature. You create the icon first using MoreIcons, then edit the offsets to your liking with Offset Assist. Simple! Therefore, this mod will **only work with MoreIcons added icons, and not with vanilla icons.** You can use MoreIcons' "Load from Traditional Icon Packs" setting to load your traditional icons via the mod and use them here, though!

To get started, simply click on the new button added to the Icon Garage, it'll look similar to the mod's logo. This button will open up the Mod's popup from where u can start working on adjusting ur offsets!

## Extra Utils
The mod also has various utilities for properly testing your icons in its popup:
- Preview Rolling Animation for Ball gamemode.
- Preview Icon Position in Ship/UFO/Jetpack gamemodes.
- Preview Any Animation in Robot/Spider gamemodes.
- Quickly toggle glow visibility on/off.
- Quick Gameplay-Accurate hitbox preview.

*As of v1.0.0, it is still not possible to automatically apply your changes to your plist file. This is already being worked on and will be added soon!*
